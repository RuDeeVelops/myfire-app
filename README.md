## About

MyFire is a minimalistic financial freedom calculator that helps you determine if you can achieve early retirement or FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). This simple, free, and open-source tool uses the Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR) method to calculate your financial independence.

## How It Works

1. Enter your current net worth and expected yearly return on investment.
2. Choose a monthly withdrawal rate (1%, 3%, or 4% SWR).
3. The calculator projects your portfolio value over time, showing you:
   - If your portfolio will last indefinitely
   - How long your portfolio will last
   - The peak value of your portfolio and when it occurs

The calculation is based on the concept of Safe Withdrawal Rate, adjusted for 3% inflation (which is why withdrawals increase every year).
